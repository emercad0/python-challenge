In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
(Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

You will be given two sets of poll data (election_data_1.csv and election_data_2.csv).
Each dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate.
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

Voter ID,County,Candidate
19456843,Marsh,Khan
12386537,Marsh,Khan
19263143,Marsh,Khan

The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.


As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:
'''






         # Add it to the list of candidates in the running
            candidate_options.append(candidate_name)

            # And begin tracking that candidate's voter count
            candidate_votes[candidate_name] = 0

        # Then add a vote to that candidate's count
        candidate_votes[candidate_name] += 1
